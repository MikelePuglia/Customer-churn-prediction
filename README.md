**Introduction**

The dataset refers to the data of the customers of ABC Multistate Bank, analyzing the cases of abandonment or interruption of the use of the services offered by the bank and the closure of its accounts. The departure of the customer is a loss for the company both in terms of financial and reputation, so it is important to proactively face the potential risks of abandonment, developing targeted loyalty strategies and improving customer satisfaction. The main objective is to understand and predict the factors that influence customer abandonment by building a model appropriate to the context.
The available data (10,000 comments) consider customer behaviour in relation to some factors that could influence the decision to abandon (Churn). In particular, reference is made to 12 specific variables, including: Credit Score, Country, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Products Number, Credit Card, Active Member, Estimated Salary, Churn.

**Main steps**

The project includes 8 specific steps:

1. **Descriptive analysis:** Examining and summarizing key statistics provides an initial understanding of the dataset.
  
2. **Pre-processing:** Cleaning and transforming data ensure it is ready for analysis, addressing missing values or outliers.

3. **Data visualization:** Creating visual representations aids in interpreting patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

4. **Correlation analysis:** Assessing relationships between variables helps identify factors influencing the target variable (churn).

5. **Data splitting:** Separating data into training and testing sets ensures unbiased model evaluation.

6. **GLM construction:** Building Generalized Linear Models tailors regression to non-normally distributed response variables, such as binary churn outcomes.

7. **Model validation:** Assessing model performance on unseen data ensures its reliability and generalizability.

8. **Conclusion:** Summarizing findings and recommendations based on the analysis provides insights for strategic decision-making.
